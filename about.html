                                        Susan is a 15 year veteran of the relocation management industry with a unique twist, having been with the same core team which has transitioned through three brand identities. She entered the relocation marketplace when she joined Matrix International,
                                        then the Northeast’s leading international moving/forwarding entity. Through an acquisition Matrix evolved into Agility International, where Susan served in the capacity of General Manager of the CT operation. She
                                        has now transitioned into the General Manager’s position at Kinetix International Logistics CT where she has been reunited with key former team members in helping to lead “a financially strong start-up with 250
                                        years’ experience within the lead players”. During her career, she has been responsible for service deliverables to key corporate clients such as The United Nations and Cartus Corporation. Susan’s company focus
                                        includes Client Services Relations, ultimate management of sales and operations and P&L maintenance for Kinetix New York. Susan’s responsibility is to ensure that all client deliverables are executed in a smooth
                                        and efficient manner.
